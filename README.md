# SlowLifeGUI
Conway's Game of Life, in GUI Form.  Deliberately non-performant.


Started with a version of Conway's Game of Life that was not performing well.
The idea of this project was to use a profiler to find the methods causing the program to perform badly.
Next, I had to create pinning tests to ensure that any changes made to the game would not change the edge cases of the program.
Finally, I had to refactor the methods causing problems and create a writeup on the results.
